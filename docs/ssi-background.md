## What is SSI?
SSI stands for Self-Sovereign Identity, which can be defined as a lifetime, portable, digital identity that does not depend on any centralized authority. 
In order for a system like this to be successful, it needs to adhere to a set of guiding principles (see [Christopher Allen’s Ten Principles of SSI](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html) and [this Medium post](https://medium.com/metadium/introduction-to-self-sovereign-identity-and-its-10-guiding-principles-97c1ba603872) ).
