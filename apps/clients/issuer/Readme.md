Entities which issue Credentials. 

Most issuers are organizations such as government agencies (passports), financial institutions (credit cards), universities (degrees), corporations (employment credentials), NGOs (membership cards), hospitals (health certificates or passports), etc. 

However individuals can also be issuers, and so can thingsâ€”for example a properly equipped sensor could issue a digitally-signed credential about a sensor reading.
